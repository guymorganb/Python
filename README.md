Welcome to my Python projects repository! This is a diverse collection of Python applications and scripts, including everything from a Sudoku solver to a full-stack Flask application. Dive into each project to see Python's versatility and my problem-solving capabilities.

## Projects Overview

- `PythonSudokuSolver`: An efficient Sudoku solver that can tackle even the toughest puzzles.
- `python-newsfeed`: A full-stack Flask application that manages user sessions and integrates with an SQL database using SQLAlchemy. It's perfect for understanding web development with Python.
- `python_venv_dir`: This directory houses a variety of graphics projects using Tkinter. It includes a functional Pong game and the beginnings of a web scraping project.
- `randomScripts`: A collection of Jupyter notebooks with miscellaneous scripts, showcasing data manipulation, analysis, and more.
