#The plan

#Scraping and Data Collection: You will use Python to scrape the data from the web and save it to a file. This is a great starting point to gather the required data.

#Parsing and Data Processing: You will develop a separate parsing algorithm in Python to read the saved data file and perform the necessary processing, filtering, and sorting operations. This step allows you to structure the data in a way that can be easily consumed and analyzed.

#Data Labeling: Once the data is parsed, you can label it to provide additional information or categorization. Labeling the data can help in training an ML model later on.

#Backend Setup with Java: You plan to use Java to create a backend setup that handles requests from your frontend. Java is a popular choice for building robust and scalable server-side applications. It can handle the communication between your frontend and backend systems.

#Frontend Development: Your frontend will run JavaScript and Node.js. JavaScript is the language of the web and widely used for client-side interactions, while Node.js allows JavaScript to be run on the server-side. This combination will enable you to create a dynamic and interactive user interface.

#User Preferences and ML Model: You intend to train an ML model to make data recommendations based on user preferences set through the frontend. This is a great application of ML, as it can help personalize the data presented to users based on their specific interests or preferences.
